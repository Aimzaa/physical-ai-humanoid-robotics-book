# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Book - Tasks Updated with Constitution Compliance

## Outcome
Successfully updated the tasks for the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics book project to include mandatory constitution compliance validation as required by the project constitution.

## Summary
Updated the tasks.md file to include Phase 8 with mandatory constitution compliance validation tasks and Phase 9 with final polish tasks. The new phases ensure that all constitution requirements are met before implementation can proceed, specifically addressing zero AI hallucinations, official documentation reference requirements, readability standards, and specification validation criteria.

## Key Elements
- Phase 8: Mandatory Constitution & Specification Compliance Validation
- Phase 9: Final Polish & Deployment (only after Phase 8 is 100% complete)
- Tasks T086-T090: Constitution compliance verification
- Tasks T091-T096: Final validation and deployment

## Dependencies & Parallel Execution
- Phase 8 tasks must be 100% completed before any further implementation
- Dependencies remain the same as original plan
- All constitution requirements now have specific tasks assigned

## Validation
- All constitution requirements now have dedicated tasks
- Tasks follow the required checklist format
- Compliance verification is now mandatory before proceeding
- Verification log requirement ensures accountability

## Evaluation
The updated tasks provide comprehensive coverage of all constitution requirements while maintaining the original project structure. The mandatory compliance validation phase ensures that all constitution requirements will be met before the project can proceed to implementation.
